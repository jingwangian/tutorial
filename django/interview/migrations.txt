Migrations
Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema. They’re designed to be mostly automatic, but you’ll need to know when to make migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into.

The Commands
------------------
migrate
    which is responsible for applying and unapplying migrations.

makemigrations
    which is responsible for creating new migrations based on the changes you have made to your models.

sqlmigrate
    which displays the SQL statements for a migration.

showmigrations
    which lists a project’s migrations and their status.


You should think of migrations as a version control system for your database schema. makemigrations is responsible for packaging up your model changes into individual migration files - analogous to commits - and migrate is responsible for applying those to your database.
