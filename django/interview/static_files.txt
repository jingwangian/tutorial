Managing static files (e.g. images, JavaScript, CSS)

Configuring static files

1. Make sure that django.contrib.staticfiles is included in your INSTALLED_APPS.

2. In your settings file, define STATIC_URL, for example:
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'

3. In your templates, either hardcode the url like /static/my_app/example.jpg or, preferably, use the static template tag to build the URL for the given relative path by using the configured STATICFILES_STORAGE storage (this makes it much easier when you want to switch to a content delivery network (CDN) for serving static files).

4. Store your static files in a folder called static in your app. For example my_app/static/my_app/example.jpg.
