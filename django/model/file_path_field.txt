FilePathField
-------------------
Define: class FilePathField(path=None, match=None, recursive=False, max_length=100, **options)

A CharField whose choices are limited to the filenames in a certain directory on the filesystem. Has three special arguments, of which the first is required:

FilePathField.path (Required)
    The absolute filesystem path to a directory from which this FilePathField should get its choices. Example: "/home/images".

FilePathField.match (Optional)
    A regular expression, as a string, that FilePathField will use to filter filenames.
    Note that the regex will be applied to the base filename, not the full path.
    Example: "foo.*\.txt$", which will match a file called foo23.txt but not bar.txt or foo23.png.

FilePathField.recursive (Optional)
    Either True or False. Default is False.
    Specifies whether all subdirectories of path should be included

FilePathField.allow_files (Optional)
    Either True or False. Default is True.
    Specifies whether files in the specified location should be included. Either this or allow_folders must be True.

FilePathField.allow_folders (Optional)
    Either True or False. Default is False.
    Specifies whether folders in the specified location should be included. Either this or allow_files must be True.

Example:
    FilePathField(path="/home/images", match="foo.*", recursive=True)

    will match /home/images/foo.png but not /home/images/foo/bar.png because the match applies to the base filename (foo.png and bar.png).

FilePathField instances are created in your database as varchar columns with a default max length of 100 characters. As with other fields, you can change the maximum length using the max_length argument.
